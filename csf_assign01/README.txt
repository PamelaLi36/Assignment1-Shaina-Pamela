Shaina Gabala
Pamela Li

We both worked together on all parts of the code during multiple zoom sessions while screen sharing. On our first meeting, Pamela had came in with pseudo code on how she had thought about some functions; Shaina had also some thoughts on how to piece everything together; together we compared our logic and worked to turn pseudo code into actual lines of code.

We then implemented all code together using ubuntu, checking for compiler errors and debugging together. We attended some office hours and made sure when someone had free time to work on assignment she would, and we would meet up later to work over it.
